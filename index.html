  <p> <BR> Conceptual aspect:</BR> An abstract portrayal of your own human figure decaying over time. The little particles that make up who you 
      are slowly diminishing and fraying to give a more contemporary take on aging, while being interactive with the user. 
  </p>
  <p2> <BR>Performace and behind the scenes:<BR>  Using a button imput to activate the camera and the effects (with a disclaimer the camera will be activated) It triggers 
    JavaScript and P5's pixel sorting data algorithm that allows you to pick and sort the pixels from your media. The website activates the camera on your device 
    and Java begins to sort the pixels in a method of following light using RGB sensoring. The light following technique makes so that when the content in the 
    camera is moving it is changing the RBG pixels and their light value which makes the pixels move when the content in the camera moves. It is designed to stick
    to the person in the photo (prefferably infront of a dark background so the pixels encase them for majority of the effect) The aging qualities occur when the
    pixels are demanded to shrink from their originally oversized position. Giving the illusion of your bodily material shrinking, fraying, and then slowly disapearing. 
    Until the pixels are so small they are no longer visible. The more movement in the camera, the more dislocated, energetic, and displaced the pixels become.
    (pixels movement is highly prominent when moving the actual device instead of just the movement in the camera)
